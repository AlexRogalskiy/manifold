# The Javascript Manifold

The Javascript Manifold (Manifold.js) is a [Manifold](http://manifold.systems/) extension library that allows for seamless interaction with javascript
resources from Java using the [Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino) project.

The library supports the use of javascript programs from Java, the use of ES6-flavored javascript classes from
java, the use of Java classes from javascript, as well as the creation of type-safe javascript expressions for
use in Java as a scripting layer.

See [here](http://manifold.systems/manifold-js.html) for the documentation.
