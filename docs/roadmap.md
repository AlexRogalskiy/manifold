# Roadmap

## On the workbench

 I haven't quite committed to anything big at the moment. For now I'm reviewing bugs and looking for small stuff
 to fortify existing features until I figure out what is next. Visit the Manifold [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/manifold-group/shared_invite/zt-e0bq8xtu-93ASQa~a8qe0KDhOoD6Bgg)
 to discuss ideas etc.
 
 Currently working on [240](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/issues/240).
